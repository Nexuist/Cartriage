### Legacy

This is Cartriage v4.0. The code has not been touched at all, so any improvements in 5.0 have not been carried over here. I don't recommend using this version. It's simply here for historical purposes.

### Dependencies

Instead of `pysnmp`, v4.0 uses `easysnmp`.

### Usage

Exactly the same as 5.0. The only difference between the versions is a rewritten backend.
